Login Designer is the best way to style a custom login page for your WordPress login, register and forgot password forms, right from the live-action WordPress Customizer.

== Description ==

You shouldn't have to hire a developer to customize your website's login page. That's why I built Login Designer, the best login customizer plugin for WordPress.

While Login Designer is not the first WordPress plugin designed for styling custom login pages, it offers an unrivaled live-editing experience unlike any other.

**Login Designer's login customizing and templating experience is the best in class - by a long shot**.

= Faster. Better. Stronger - Login Designer v1.3 =

We are excited to introduce Login Designer v1.3 that is equipped with new features, improvements and fixes. Here's what's new in the latest update:

* Language switcher - Users can switch to multiple languages which the admin has selected from the back end.
* Login error message customization - You can customize messages for login and password fields (required and invalid).
* Added pencil icons on editable settings - You can edit just about anything from colors and sizes to texts and fonts.
* Import & Export settings - Users can import and export settings using custom CSS.
* Google ReCaptcha settings - You can now secure the login form using Google ReCaptcha V3.

= An unparalleled custom login styling experience =

Zero refreshes. Contextually displayed options and plugin settings. Custom event triggers. Context-aware previews. Powerful custom controls. Live editing...the list goes on.

Login Designer is a UX beast.

It's familiar, yet completely revolutionary. Click on any element from your login page to fine tune it. That element's settings are contextually displayed, while others hide. This way, you'll spend less time navigating the Customizer's sections and panels, and more time actually fine-tuning your website's login page.
